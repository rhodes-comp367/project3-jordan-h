# Final project

**Explain the general theme and specific features of your project.**



**Cite any resources or existing code you used.**



**Discuss any challenges, or anything you'd like feedback on.**


Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening Professor Superdock,

I hope you are doing well. This is my final project. As you know, this is based on a calculator. I have basic functions(add, multiple, subtract, negate, etc.), and I have their seperate tests defined towards the end of the file. I tried my very best not to use any form of A.I. in the entire project. And I am proud to say that I did not. Outside of class help, I watched a few youtube vidoes and looked at webistes(linked at the end of this file). No imports, as every data type was defined. I also took the additional functions(maybe, expand) and expanded upon them. 

Challenges: 
I had a lot of trouble with the basic implementation of things; from simple syntax errors to function/datatype implementation. I also had trouble defining dependent types outside of very basic ones. I understand that because of the lack of complexity, that this project may not be up to your standards, but I do want you to know that I tried my very best. In particualar, I would like feedback on the functionality(if that makes sense) of the entire project as a functioning calculator. 

For any other questions you might have, I would say that the in-code comments do help a lot.
